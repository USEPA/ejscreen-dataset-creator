# EJScreenDatasetCreator

## Description
`EJScreenDatasetCreator` is a python tool that automates the calculation of EJScreen indexes(`calIndexes`), percentiles(`percentileCal`/`percentileCalState`), bin/text fields(`calBinTxt`), and lookup tables to create the production EJScreen 2023 dataset. There is also the option join the resultant table to matching block groups or tracts to create a feature class within an Esri file geodatabase(`exportSpatial`).

## Python Package Requirements
All required packages come preinstalled in the default ArcGIS Pro 3.1 environment, which includes python 3. The following are the packages and versions used in the development of this tool. 

| Package       | Version       | 
| ------------- |--------------:|
| python        | 3.9.16        | 
| pandas        | 1.4.4         | 
| numpy         | 1.20.1        | 
| arcgis        | 2.1.0.2       |  
| arcpy         | 3.1           |

ArcGIS Pro is required to export the results to an Esri feature class. 
## Input Requirements

A csv file containing the required columns to generate an EJScreen dataset. These column names are designated in `col_names.py`. By default, the following columns are required:

| `col_names.info_names`       | `col_names.data_names`      | `col_names.extra_cols`      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

## How to Use

To run the tool, download the files to a local folder. From there, open `ejscreen_dataset.py` and update the following parameters:
* option - Must be a value of 1 or 2. If the value is 1, then percentiles will be calculated at the national level. If the value is 2, then percentiles will be calculated at the state level. 
* input_ejscreen_csv - file path to the input ejscreen dataset for which is used to generate the output
* output_ejscreen_csv - file path to output ejscreen csv file that will be generated by the tool
* output_lookuptable_xlsx - file path to output lookup table excel file that will be generated by the tool
* output_to_featureclass - True or False. If True, then join output ejscreen table to matching geometry based on "ID" column and export to  feature class
* geometry_source_featureclass - file path to block group/tract feature class that the output table will be joined to
* output_featureclass_name - file path to the output feature class that will be generated by the tool
* schema_csv - file path to schema csv file. This is used as part of the Batch Update Fields geoprocessing tool which sets field order, length, data type, and alias. `ejscreen_schema.csv` is included in this repository and can be used in this case. More information the Batch Update Fields tool can be found [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/batch-update-fields.htm).

Once the parameters have been updated, run the python file to generate the output.
